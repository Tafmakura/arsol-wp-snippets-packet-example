        <h4>Granular packet control demonstration</h4>
        <p>This section is <span class="included-css-class-red">red</span> and <span class="included-css-class-blue">blue</span> when the nested CSS file "Example Nested CSS with Granular Control" is enabled, when the file is disabled the css classes will be disabled.</p>
        <div class="css-demo-content">
            <p>You can control the styling of this section by enabling or disabling the CSS file through the Arsol WP Snippets plugin.</p>
            <p>When enabled, the word "<span class="included-css-class-red">red</span>" will be red and the word "<span class="included-css-class-blue">blue</span>" will be blue.</p>
            <p>When disabled, all text will be black.</p>

        <h4>How This Content Works:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Content is generated through PHP functions in included files</li>
            <li>Styling is applied through a nested CSS file added via <code>arsol_wp_snippets_css_addon_files</code> filter</li>
            <li>CSS can be disabled granularly, allowing for complex combinations of styling</li>
            <li>Multiple included files can work together to create rich functionality</li>
            <li>HTML templates can be loaded from external files for better organization and maintainability</li>
        </ol>
    </div>


    <p> All this demonstrates how a packet can include its own files, provide functionality through shortcodes, manage styling through nested CSS files that can be enabled/disabled independently, and load HTML templates from external files.</p>
